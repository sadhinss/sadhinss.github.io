  <div class="about-text">
    <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Shams Sadhin</strong>, an undergraduate at the University of Cincinnati, double majoring in <em>Economics</em> and <em>Business Analytics</em> with a minor in <em>Mathematics</em>. I’m passionate about applying data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems, particularly in urban economics, real estate, and policy research.</p>

    <p>My experience includes being a research assistant for Dr. Gary Painter at the Lindner Real Estate Center, Resident Advisor and PACE Leader. I enjoy combining academic research with hands-on application, and I’m currently exploring opportunities in data analytics, policy, and finance.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I love playing — tennis, badminton, basketball, watching TV shows, travelling, and eating!</p>
