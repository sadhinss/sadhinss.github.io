Hi! I’m **Shams Sadhin**, an undergraduate at the University of Cincinnati, double majoring in *Economics* and *Business Analytics* with a minor in *Mathematics*. I’m passionate about applying data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems, particularly in urban economics, real estate, and policy research.

My experience includes being a research assistant for Dr. Gary Painter at the Lindner Real Estate Center, Resident Advisor and PACE Leader. I enjoy combining academic research with hands-on application, and I’m currently exploring opportunities in data analytics, policy, and finance.

Outside of work, I love playing - tennis, badminton, basketball, watching TV shows, travelling and eating!
